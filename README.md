The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch Project for Javascript skill development

The etch-a-sketch project was completed as the second javascript project in The Odin Project Fundamentals course. The project contains a grid of squares that change from a light gray background to a black background when the mouse enters the square. The new grid button prompts the user for a grid size and uses the input to create a new grid. 

-Core skills: Javascript, HTML, CSS

-Detailed skills: loops, appending to DOM, setting attributes via JS, button event listener, mouse enter event listener, user input.
